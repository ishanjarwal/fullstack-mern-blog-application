# Full Stack MERN Blog App
## üîéOverview
This is a blog application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) with Vite. The application allows users to create their accounts and manage their profiles (including display picture) and further lets them create, edit, and delete blog posts. The login system is built using the JWT (jsonwebtokens). The application uses react-router-dom for routing without refreshing the page. At the backend, robust api's have been written including data limits, proper form validations using express-validator and limited access is made sure using authentication middlewares. The styling is done with TailwindCSS.
